# ToDoList
The Task:
Create an offline TODO App for the browser using React JS.
Key Features:
A simple input bar to add Todo(s) on pressing the return key.
A list of TODO cards where each todo is appended on creation.
A reset button on the top right corner of the App to clear all Todo(s) and return to the
initial state.
Hitting the refresh button (including hard refresh) in the browser should not cause
any change in the state of the app (it should work like a regular offline app).
